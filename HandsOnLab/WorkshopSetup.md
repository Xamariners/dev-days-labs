# Xamarin Workshop Setup

## Introduction

Xamarin requires a few components to collaborate for a satisfying development experience. It is important that each participant to the workshop installs and tests the setup prior to the workshop day, so that we donâ€™t lose any time and can jump into code as soon as possible ðŸ˜Š

> Note: If you start from scratch, you will automatically get the latest and greatest version of each components. If however you already had Visual Studio or Xamarin installed, you might need to upgrade your installation. For more information, see [the corresponding section below](#upgrading-your-android-sdk-to-the-latest-version).

In the workshop we will use the Android SDK 9.0 (Pie).

## Configurations

You can develop for Xamarin using Windows or Mac. However if you use Windows and want to build Xamarin apps for iOS, you need a Mac computer too. This is because of Apple restrictions and cannot be avoided. During the workshop, we will support the following configurations:

__From a Windows PC:__

* Preferred: Develop for Android devices using a physical device connected through USB.
* Develop for Android devices using an emulator running on the PC directly.

__From a Mac:__

* Preferred: Develop for Android devices using a physical device connected through USB.
* Develop for iOS devices using a physical device connected through USB.
* Develop for Android devices using an emulator running on the Mac directly.
* Develop for iOS devices using a simulator running on the Mac directly.

__Keys to success:__

* Bring your own Windows PC and/or Mac PC to the workshop. Make sure to follow the instructions below for the Xamarin setup.
* If you have one, we recommend that you bring your own Android or iOS devices to the workshop. This is the easiest way to test your application

## Prerequisites on a Windows PC

You can see the requirements and follow the steps in the [Xamarin environment setup on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/cross-platform/get-started/installation/windows/?WT.mc_id=mobileappsoftomorrow-workshop-jabenn).

1. Install Visual Studio 2019 from [VisualStudio.com](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/?WT.mc_id=mobileappsoftomorrow-workshop-jabenn). The free Community Edition is sufficient for this workshop.
2. Make sure to select the _"Mobile development with .NET"_ workload in the installer screen:
   ![The Xamarin workload selected in the installer](./Images/Setup/VS2019Workload.png)

> There can be issues running emulators or connecting to physical devices if you are running Visual Studio in a Virtual Machine. Ideally you should run on the natively installed OS, but if you are using a virtual machine it is important to validate the setup before attempting the workshop.

### Testing the setup

After the installation is complete, test the setup with the following steps:

1. In Visual Studio, select File, New, Project.
2. In the "Create a new project" dialog, type "xamarin" in the search box.
3. Select "Mobile App (Xamarin.Forms)" and click on `Next`.

4. In the "Configure your new project" dialog box, enter a name and a location for your new application.

![Configure your project](./Images/Setup/VS2019ConfigureNewProject.png)

4. In the "New Cross Platform App" dialog, select "Blank".
5. Under Platform, select "Windows (UWP)" and "Android". Deselect "iOS".
6. Press OK.

With the application created in Visual Studio, we will now test on Windows and on the Android emulator. If this works fine, we will guide you during the workshop to deploy to your devices.

#### Running on Windows

Now we will try running the application in Windows and Android to see if everything works fine.

1. In the Solution Explorer, right click on the UWP version of the application and select "Set as Startup Project" from the context menu.
   ![Setting the UWP app as the startup app](./Images/Setup/VS2017SetUWPASStartup.png)
2. Select x86 Build Configuration
3. Select Debug Build Configuration
4. Click on the Start button with "Local Machine".
   ![Running the UWP app on the local machine](./Images/Setup/VS2017RunUWP.png)
5. After a short wait, you should see the UWP version of the application running.

#### Running on Android

1. In the Solution Explorer, right click on the Android application and select "Set as Startup Project" from the context menu.
   ![Setting the Android app as the startup app](./Images/Setup/VS2017SetAndroidAsStartup.png)
2. In the Start button, the Android emulator should be selected as shown below:
   ![The Android emulator selected in the start button](./Images/Setup/VS2019RunningAndroid.png)
3. Click on the Start button to run the Android emulator.
   > You might have to select a video device when the emulator starts for the first time. You donâ€™t have to select anything, you can just press OK. The emulator takes some time to boot, but once it is up and running, you donâ€™t need to shut it down. It can just stay up.

   After the emulator runs, you should be able to see the application:

## Prerequisites on a Mac

You can see the requirements and follow the steps in the [Xamarin environment setup on Mac](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/mac/installation/?WT.mc_id=mobileappsoftomorrow-workshop-jabenn).

1. Install Visual Studio for Mac from [VisualStudio.com](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/?WT.mc_id=mobileappsoftomorrow-workshop-jabenn). The free Community Edition is sufficient for this workshop.
2. Open the App Store app on macOS, search for Xcode and install Xcode. Visual Studio requires Xcode to build the iOS applications as well as run them on the Simulator.
   > Important: After you finish installing Xcode, run it once to make sure that all the necessary component are up to date. Some components are only downloaded the first time that Xcode runs.

### Testing the setup

After the installation is complete, test the setup with the following steps:

1. In Visual Studio for Mac, select New Project.
   ![The New Project button in VS for Mac](./Images/Setup/VSMacNewProject.png)
2. In the "Choose a templateâ€¦" dialog, select Multiplatform, App, Forms App, then press Next.
